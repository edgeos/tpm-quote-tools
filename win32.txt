Notes when trying to use these with Windows XP:

0. Make sure TPM is turned on, and (possibly) "activate security" is also
turned on (both in the BIOS; in different menus for mine).

1. To allow remote quotes with NTRU's TSS, in the registry set
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\NTRU Cryptosystems\TSS\allowRemoteRPC to 1
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\NTRU Cryptosystems\TSS\allowRemoteSOAP to 1
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\NTRU Cryptosystems\TSS\allowSOAPTCS to 1
	1.1 Currently with NTRU's TSS, doing things remotely (whether sending or
		receiving the request) does not work. It will set up the TCP
		connection, do nothing for 10 seconds, then close the connection. This
		has been reported to NTRU.

2. To get the iconv.h file, download libiconv from GNU, compile and install it.
	2.1 Make sure the folder with iconv.h is on the include path.
	2.2 Add -llibcharset and -liconv to LIBS parameter in configure script
