	* configure.ac: Tagged as 1.0.

2010-12-03  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* tidy.c: Added support for ensuring resources associated with a
	context are freed, and incorporated this support into the files
	that contain the main function of a program.

2010-11-17  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* configure.ac: Tagged as 0.9.

	* *.c: Included stddef.h.  This fixes a compile time error for the
	case in which trousers or iconv is not available.

2010-11-15  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* tpm_updatepcrhash.c (main): Allowed updates to a hash when the
	PCR selection changes too.

	* control: Added support for Debian packaging.

	* tpm-quote-tools.spec.in: Added support for RPMs.

2010-11-11  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* tpm_updatepcrhash.c (main): Cleaned up the code that reads PCR
	values from a file, and eliminated the use of GNU extensions.  The
	code should now be accepted by any C99 compiler and be easier to
	read.

	The code reading the PCR file now checks to ensure it does not
	contain two lines that specify the same PCR.  Such a file would
	create a flawed hash value.

	The code now uses TrouSerS hash updates that are specifically
	designed for TPM_PCR_SELECTIONs and the like.  As a result, the
	code no longer computes the blob associated with a PCR composite
	hash, and then hashes that value, making the code more obvious.

2010-11-09  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* tpm_updatepcrhash.c (main): Corrected a flaw in the update hash
	code that caused the newly computed composite hash to over write
	the existing nonce instead of the old hash.

2010-11-08  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* configure.ac: Added the --without-tss12 option to force the use
	of the 1.1b version of TPM quote.

	* tpm_getquote.c (main): Added the -p option that stores the PCR
	values in a file.

2010-11-05  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* tpm_verifyquote.c (main): Removed connection request as there is
	no need to connect to the TCG daemon while verifying a quote.

	* configure.ac: Added test for the presence of TrouSerS.

	* tpm_updatepcrhash.c: Added program for updating a hash.

	* tpm_getpcrhash.c: This program now saves the PCR values is a
	separate file.  Editing this file can be used to during the
	process of updating a hash.

2010-11-01  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* COPYING: Changed license to BSD.

	* configure.ac: Tagged as 0.8.

	* tpm_quote_tools.8: Expanded the description of the collection of
	tools. 

	* tpm_mkaik.c (main): Added support for TSS UNICODE encoding for
	passwords.

	* tpm_*.c: Added -h and -v options.  Changed the option used to
	specify a remote host to -r so as to allow -h be the usual option
	for help.

2010-10-29  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* configure.ac: Tagged as 0.7.

2010-10-28  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* tpm_mkaik.c (getpasswd): Added an OpenSSL UI based password
	reader when OpenSSL is available to get around a TrouSerS bug.

	* tpm_mkaik.c (main): Fixed a bug in command line handling.  The
	sense of the -z was reversed in the previous release, so that by
	default, tpm_mkaik used the well known secret, and -z told it
	request an owner secret.

2010-10-27  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* configure.ac: Tagged as 0.6.

	* Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Added manual pages.

	* tpm_mkaik.c (main): Added the ability to query for the owner
	secret.

2010-10-26  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* tpm_unloadkey.c: Added a program that unregisters a key.

	* loadkey.c (loadkey): Removed spurious creation of a TPM handle.

2010-09-13  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* configure.ac: Tagged as 0.5.

	* quote.c (quote): Use Tspi_TPM_Quote2 when HAVE_TSS_12_LIB is
	defined. 

2010-07-20  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* takeownership.c (main): Routine gets the EK and supplies it to
	the takeownership call rather than using the null handle so as to
	get around a bug in NTRU's tsp1.dll.

2010-07-01  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* configure.ac: Tagged as 0.3.

2010-05-22  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* configure.ac: Added support for MinGW and Cygwin platforms.

	* tpm_getpcrhash.c (main): Added an option so that one can supply
	the name of a host as a UTF-16LE string for Tspi_Context_Connect.

2010-03-17  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* tpm_loadkey.c (main): Added a program that just loads a key.

	* tpm_verifyquote.c (main): Program accepts the quote from
	standard input as well as from a file.

2010-03-16  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* tpm_getquote.c (main): Added an option so that one can supply
	the name of a host as a UTF-16LE string for Tspi_Context_Connect.

	* get_num_pcrs.c: Removed this file, which contained a
	TPM_GetCapability request for the number of PCRs.  Why pay the
	price for an extra transaction when a later quote request will
	fail when given a bad PCR mask?

	* quote.c (quote): Removed the call to get_num_pcrs and the call
	to check_pcr_mask.

	* pcr_mask.c: Removed function check_pcr_mask.
