TPM QUOTE TOOLS NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

* Changes in version 1.0
   This is a bug fix release with no user-visible changes.

* Changes in version 0.9

** Added tmp_updatepcrhash program which updates a PCR hash

** tpm_qetquote now optionally stores the PCR values in a file

** License changed to BSD

* Changes in version 0.8

** Command line options regularized
   All programs now accept the -h and -v options.  The flag for remote
   host access has been changed to -r so that -h can be used for help.

** Unicode option for tpm_mkaik
   The -u option for tpm_mkaik provides support for TSS UNICODE
   encoding of owner passwords.

** Manual page improvements
   The overview manual page has been expanded.

* Changes in version 0.7

** Program tpm_mkaik gets passwords using OpenSSL
   When OpenSSL GUI support is available, tpm_mkaik uses it to prompt
   for the owner password.  This fixes a bug in the previous version.

* Changes in version 0.6

** Program tpm_mkaik has the ability to query for the owner secret
   When TrouSerS is compiled without GUI support, no passwort prompt
   appears, and an error is generated.  In this case, the owner secret
   must be the well known secret.

** There are manual pages for each program

** Program tpm_unloadkey added
   Added a program that unregisters a binding between a UUID and a key.
